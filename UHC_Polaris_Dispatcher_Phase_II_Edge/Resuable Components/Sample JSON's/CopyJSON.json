// To copy files from one location to another provide the source and destination and the file name of the file to be copied.
// To copy all files put "*" in Regex.
// To copy files based on some criteria specify the proper regex. Follow regex pattern for vb.net.
// Specify either the regex or filename. Put null or "" in regex or filenanme if not specified.
// Try to give absolute paths in the source and destination as relative path may not work sometimes.
// NAS drive paths should have "\\\\" in the starting as JSON remove unnecessary escape sequences. Eg. "\\\\nas00782pn\\data\\TEG_RPA_SHARE_DRIVE\\Tech_maturity\\CommonLog"
// To delete the file from the source set "DeleteSource" to True.
// If destination folder doesnot exists and the user wants it should be created automatically set "CreateDestination" to True.
