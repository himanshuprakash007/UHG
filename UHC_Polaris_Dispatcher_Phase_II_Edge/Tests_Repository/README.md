## Tests Repository

**Tests_Repository** folder hold tests that are to be run automatically by the framework.
Here we have created Unit Test workflows for each block of the UiPathCoreFramework.

#### Naming of Tests

The **Unit Tests** workflow name should start with the **order number** in which the test case sholud be run followed by the name of the workflow for which the test has been createtd. 

Naming Convention used in example templates: **1_UnitTest_WorkflowName**

The names of the pre-created Unit Test workflows are as follows

* 1_UnitTest_InitAllSettings

* 2_UnitTest_InitAllApplications_and_CloseAllApplications

* 3_UnitTest_SetData

* 4_UnitTest_KillAllProcess
